# Iris-Data-Analysis
This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs a data analysis on the famous Iris dataset using Python and several libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn.  The Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset that includes the measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. 
The Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset that includes the measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset contains four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and one target variable (species).

The goals of this project are to:

Explore and understand the dataset
Visualize the distribution and correlation of the features
Perform a principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset
Train a logistic regression model to predict the species of the iris flowers
The notebook consists of several sections that cover these goals:

Data Loading and Exploration: This section loads the dataset from the seaborn library and prints the first five rows of the dataset. It also prints the summary statistics of the dataset and checks for missing values.
Data Visualization: This section visualizes the distribution and correlation of the features using histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and a heatmap.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): This section performs a PCA on the dataset and plots the PCA results.
Logistic Regression Model: This section trains a logistic regression model on the dataset and prints the accuracy, coefficients, and intercept of the model. It also uses the model to predict the species of a new flower.
The notebook also includes comments and explanations for each step of the analysis.

To run the notebook, you need to install the required libraries by running this command in your terminal or command prompt:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

You can then open the notebook in Jupyter and run the cells.

Feel free to use, modify, and distribute this notebook for educational or research purposes. If you have any questions or feedback, please contact me at [Discord- krayn1.618].

Thank You...
